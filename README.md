## Introduction
In this course we will convert the client side web application made earlier at the OBA to a server side rendered application. We are also going to implement a series of optimisations to improve the performance of the application. Ultimately we ensure that the application is available offline.

Some resources possess an emoticon to help you understand which type of content you may find:

- 📖: Documentation or article
- 🛠: Tool or library
- 📹: Video

<!-- How about a section that describes how to install this project? 🤓 -->
## Installation
1. Open your terminal
2. Change the directory to a folder in which you want to place the files
```bash
cd /~path
```
3. Clone the repository (you're going to need [Git](https://www.linode.com/docs/development/version-control/how-to-install-git-on-linux-mac-and-windows/))
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mennauu/performance-matters-1819
```

## Optimisations

### First view
___

#### Compression
The first thing I did was add compression. Brotli compression seems to be the most efficient.
```diff
+ HTML size reduction 71,4%
+ CSS size reduction: 54,8%
+ JQUERY size reduction: 72,9%
```
<details>
  <summary>Network results based on a slow 3G network</summary>
<br>

**Without compression**
```
HTML: Size 4.2 KB | Time 2.09s
CSS: Size 3.1 KB | Time 2.27s
JQUERY: Size 247 KB | Time 8.14s

28 requests | 1326 KB transferred | Finish 15.31s | DOMContentLoaded: 12.34s | Load 13.29s
```

**With Gzip (no jQuery)**
```
HTML: Size 1.2 KB | Time 2.01s
CSS: Size 1.4 KB | Time 2.04s

27 requests | 105 KB transferred | Finish 13.40s | DOMContentLoaded: 2.06s | Load 11.38s
```

**With Brotli**
```
HTML: Size 1.0 KB | Time 2.01s
CSS: Size 1.4 KB | Time 2.03s
JQUERY: Size: 66.9 KB | Time 3.65s

28 requests | 138 KB transferred | Finish 14.41s | DOMContentLoaded: 6.18s | Load 12.39s
```
</details>

#### Minifying
I minified CSS and JavaScript (jQuery)

```diff
+ CSS size reduction: 17,7%
+ JQUERY size reduction: 63.4%
```
<details>
  <summary>Network results based on a slow 3G network</summary>
<br>

**Not minified**
```
CSS: Size 1.7 KB | Time 2.25s
JQUERY: Size: 66.9 KB | Time 3.65s
```

**Minified**
```
Size: 1.4 KB | Time: 2.08s
jQUERY: 24.5 KB | Time 2.78s
```
</details>

___

#### Images to WebP
Support is weak for WebP, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't use it in browsers that can actually make use of it. We can use a fallback. Browsers that don't support the picture tag, or webp files, will just ignore those lines and render the fallback image in the img tag.
```diff
+ Total images size reduction: 32%
```

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="{{cover_image}}" type="image/webp">
  <source srcset="{{cover_image_fallback}}" type="image/jpeg">
  <img src="{{cover_image_fallback}}" alt="{{genre}}">
</picture>
```

<details>
  <summary>Network results based on a slow 3G network</summary>

**Jpeg**

**WebP**

### Repeat view

#### Unique hash digits
[Staticify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/staticify) was used to add unique hash digits to css and js files (like app-67ce7f3483.css).

#### Caching
**HTML files**
* Cache-Control: no-cache
* With Etag
* No X-Powered-By

**JavaScript, CSS, and image files** 
* Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000
* No Etag, 
* No Last-Modified
* No X-Powered-By

#### Results

<!-- ## Notes (This will be removed)
* Kijk naar NPM scripts
* Kijk naar gulp of nieuwere tools dan Gulp

HET BUILDEN VAN DE HELE APP VIA NPM

- Minification
- file revisioning (rev-manifest)
- Brotli ipv GZIP
- precompression (Static site)
- img revision tag (304 - 200)
- srcset and sizes attributes 
- Picture html tag (client hints) - webp met fallbacks
- Resource hints
- DNS-PREFETCH
- link preconnect, prefetch, preload, prerender
- font subsetting
- font rendering controls (font-display: swap)
- Reflow verminderen door op de fallback font line-height en letter-spacing te plaatsen (Font style Matcher)
- fontFaceObserver (add class async (after font is loaded)) with a cookie and class
- Defer, async scripts
- Je kan styles asynchroon inladen (LoadCSS)
- Critical CSS - minimum css nodig (lijn trekken) -->

<!-- Maybe a checklist of done stuff and stuff still on your wishlist? ✅ -->
## Checklist
- [x] Rebuild client side app to server side app
- [x] Add Handlebars
- [x] Minifiy files
- [X] Add unique hash digits to css and javascript files
- [X] Add (pre)compression
- [X] Set cache headers (for caching)
